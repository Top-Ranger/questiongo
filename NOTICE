QuestionGo! - A simple survey software
   created by Marcus Soll (https://msoll.eu)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

QuestionGo! is my personal survey software.
It was developed with simplicity in mind - both in deployment and architecture.
As such, it might contain certain restrictions in terms of extensibility.
One example is that questionnaires are loaded once and than treated as immutable.
I developed the software with my specific needs in mind. It contains everything I need.
It might not fit your needs. That's ok.
But don't expect me to go out of my way implementing your requests.
I'm releasing the software in the hope that it might be helpful to others.

To run it, simply use the following commands:
go build
./questiongo

To build the SQLite backend, you have to use the following build command:
go build -tags="sqlite"

A sample configration can be found in the config folder.
A sample questionnaire (containing all features) can be found at 'data/test'.
Results can be found at the page '/results.html' on the server.
A questionnaire is expect to hold all information in a single directory.
